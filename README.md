## Installation

```bash
npm install codestate-ast
```

## Quick Start

```typescript
import { CodestateAST } from 'codestate-ast';

const parser = new CodestateAST();
const result = await parser.parseProject('./my-project');

console.log(JSON.stringify(result, null, 2));
```

## Documentation Generation

The library now includes comprehensive documentation generation capabilities:

```typescript
import { DocumentationGenerator } from 'codestate-ast';

const docGenerator = new DocumentationGenerator({
  outputFormat: 'both', // Generate both Markdown and HTML
  includeQualityMetrics: true,
  includeCoverageAnalysis: true,
  includeSuggestions: true
});

const documentation = await docGenerator.generateDocumentation(projectData);
```

### Documentation Features
- 📝 **JSDoc Extraction**: Parse and extract JSDoc comments with full tag support
- 🔍 **Type Documentation**: Generate comprehensive type information documentation
- 📚 **API Reference**: Automatic API reference generation from AST analysis
- 📄 **Multiple Formats**: Markdown and HTML output with customizable templates
- 📊 **Quality Metrics**: Coverage analysis and documentation completeness scoring
- 💡 **Smart Suggestions**: AI-free suggestions for missing or incomplete documentation

## Performance & Caching

The library includes advanced performance monitoring and caching capabilities:

```typescript
import { PerformanceMonitor, CacheManager } from 'codestate-ast';

// Performance monitoring
const monitor = new PerformanceMonitor({
  enableMemoryTracking: true,
  enableCpuTracking: true,
  maxMetricsHistory: 1000
});

// Caching system
const cacheManager = new CacheManager({
  maxSize: 1000,
  ttl: 3600000, // 1 hour
  enableCompression: true
});
```
